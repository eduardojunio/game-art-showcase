# Game Art Showcase

This repo is dedicated to showcase my artwork for games. I'm still learning, so expect rough results.

You can find previews of the vector graphics on the `preview` directory. The source graphic lives on the `vector-graphics` directory.

All the work here was created using Inkscape.
